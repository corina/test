## Instalation 

Clone repo  
- Duplicate `Sample_Branding_File_-_Mobile_-_06132016.zip` or the file sent by client  
- Extract the files inside  
+ Make the necessary changes (usually in `style.css`, `images` and `index.html`)  
+ Compress the `theme` folder and `index.html` by selecting them both and compressing, not by compressing the folder they are in  
 * Upload the resulted archive on Taleo platform
